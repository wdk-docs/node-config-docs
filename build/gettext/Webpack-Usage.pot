msgid "Right now ``node-config`` doesn’t work with `webpack <https://github.com/webpack/webpack>`_ out of the box because it reads the config files at runtime, which can’t be done when the code is running on a browser."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:10
msgid "Option 1"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:12
msgid "If you’re using Webpack 4, it includes excellent handling for complex config objects with ``DefinePlugin`` (as of 2018-05-07). Add the following to your ``webpack.config.js``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:23
msgid "You can access all fields, including nested fields, under the ``CONFIG`` object in your client-side scripts, without exposing your entire config object. Note that you won’t have access to ``get()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:27
msgid "This approach *does* work in Webpack 3, but it inserts your *entire* config object wherever it is referenced. This is not recommended."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:31
msgid "Option 2"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:33
msgid "Install the `node-config-webpack <https://github.com/arthanzel/node-config-webpack>`_ package and put the following in ``webpack.config.js``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:45
msgid "This allows you to access your configuration on the client in the global namespace ``CONFIG``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:52
msgid "You can also change the default namespace from ``CONFIG`` to something else."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:59
msgid "This method performs direct text replacement of config variables in your code with their values, and it doesn’t expose any configs that aren’t used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:64
msgid "Option 3"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:66
msgid "Below is an example of how you can use ``NODE_ENV`` at build time to have a static config built into your webpack bundle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:70
msgid "This will publish your entire config file into your front end application. If you have sensitive information you do not want downloaded, see the notes after the example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:95
msgid "Both server and client now can happily use ``import config from 'config'``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:98
msgid "If you have things in the config that you do not want to publish to the front end, you may consider making a specific ``client`` section of the config, and only publishing that key to the static json file, e.g. \\ ``import { client } from 'config';``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:103
msgid "Alternatively you could use `lodash <https://github.com/lodash/lodash>`_ ``pick`` or ``omit`` to control what data is written to the file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:108
msgid "Option 4"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/Webpack-Usage.rst:110
msgid "Another solution is to take advantage of the :ref:`Environment-Variables-node_config` with ``webpack.DefinePlugin``. With this method you **CAN** still use ``get()``."
