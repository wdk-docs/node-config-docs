msgid "Several checks are made to make sure that ``NODE_ENV`` and ``NODE_APP_INSTANCE`` values are sensible. If something appears to be unsafe or ambiguous, a warning will always be issued. If ``NODE_CONFIG_STRICT_MODE`` is set to ‘true’ or ‘1’ in the environment, an exception will be thrown to ensure that the application doesn’t start up with a configuration that might be broken."

msgid "Files named ``default`` and ``local`` have a special place in the config loading order. Since we also support files simply named after ``NODE_ENV`` we can’t be sure whether a file named ``default`` or ``local`` was meant be represent one of these special files, or after your NODE_ENV. Without Strict Mode, these files could end up being loaded *twice* in the load order which is probably not what you want."
