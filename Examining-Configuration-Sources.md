(still to be written) In a nutshell: Configurations are similar to CSS in that they *cascade* from less specific to more specific.  The `config.util.getConfigSources();` method can be used to see all sources contributing to the ultimate configuration, and the order in which they were are applied. This would allow a UI similar to a CSS inspector to show all source values, with strikethroughs for values overwritten by more specific cascading values.
